<p>Global overview
We’ve just seen the basic components inside a database. We now need to step back to see the big picture.</p>

<p>A database is a collection of information that can easily be accessed and modified. But a simple bunch of files could do the same. In fact, the simplest databases like SQLite are nothing more than a bunch of files. But SQLite is a well-crafted bunch of files because it allows you to:</p>

<p>use transactions that ensure data are safe and coherent
quickly process data even when you’re dealing with millions of data</p>

<p>More generally, a database can be seen as the following figure:</p>

<p>global overview of a database</p>

<p>Before writing this part, I’ve read multiple books/papers and every source had its on way to represent a database. So, don’t focus too much on how I organized this database or how I named the processes because I made some choices to fit the plan of this article. What matters are the different components; the overall idea is that a database is divided into multiple components that interact with each other.</p>

<p>The core components:</p>

<p>The process manager: Many databases have a pool of processes/threads that needs to be managed. Moreover, in order to gain nanoseconds, some modern databases use their own threads instead of the Operating System threads.
The network manager: Network I/O is a big issue, especially for distributed databases. That’s why some databases have their own manager.
File system manager: Disk I/O is the first bottleneck of a database. Having a manager that will perfectly handle the Operating System file system or even replace it is important.
The memory manager: To avoid the disk I/O penalty a large quantity of ram is required. But if you handle a large amount of memory, you need an efficient memory manager. Especially when you have many queries using memory at the same time.
Security Manager: for managing the authentication and the authorizations of the users
Client manager: for managing the client connections
…
The tools:</p>

<p>Backup manager: for saving and restoring a database.
Recovery manager: for restarting the database in a coherent state after a crash
Monitor manager: for logging the activity of the database and providing tools to monitor a database
Administration manager: for storing metadata (like the names and the structures of the tables) and providing tools to manage databases, schemas, tablespaces, …
…
The query Manager:</p>

<p>Query parser: to check if a query is valid
Query rewriter: to pre-optimize a query
Query optimizer: to optimize a query
Query executor: to compile and execute a query
The data manager:</p>

<p>Transaction manager: to handle transactions
Cache manager: to put data in memory before using them and put data in memory before writing them on disk
Data access manager: to access data on disk</p>

<p>For the rest of this article, I’ll focus on how a database manages an SQL query through the following processes:</p>

<p>the client manager
the query manager
the data manager (I’ll also include the recovery manager in this part)</p>

<p>Client manager
client manager in databases</p>

<p>The client manager is the part that handles the communications with the client. The client can be a (web) server or an end-user/end-application. The client manager provides different ways to access the database through a set of well-known APIs: JDBC, ODBC, OLE-DB …</p>

<p>It can also provide proprietary database access APIs.</p>

<p>When you connect to a database:</p>

<p>The manager first checks your authentication (your login and password) and then checks if you have the authorizations to use the database. These access rights are set by your DBA.
Then, it checks if there is a process (or a thread) available to manage your query.
It also checks if the database if not under heavy load.
It can wait a moment to get the required resources. If this wait reaches a timeout, it closes the connection and gives a readable error message.
Then it sends your query to the query manager and your query is processed
Since the query processing is not an “all or nothing” thing, as soon as it gets data from the query manager, it stores the partial results in a buffer and start sending them to you.
In case of problem, it stops the connection, gives you a readable explanation and releases the resources.</p>
