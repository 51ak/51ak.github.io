QUESTIo n 17</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. </p>
<p>A SQL Server 2008 instance is managed by you. A new database should be deployed, and the capacity requirements listed below should be satisfied. </p>
<p>There should be 275 GB for the database data file, while there should be 50 GB for the transactio n log file. </p>
<p>There are six 100-GB disk drives which are accessible for the database in the storage array. </p>
<p>The six disks are attached to a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) co ntroller, and the co ntroller supports RAID levels 0, 1, 5, and 10. </p>
<p>Since you are the technical support, you are required to maximize the write performance of the transactio n log. </p>
<p>In additio n, you should protect the database and transactio n log files, when a drive fails. </p>
<p>The storage system should be designed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;From the following four storage co nfiguratio n, which o ne should you utilize?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;A single RAID 5 volume should be utilized.<br />
B.&nbsp;A RAID 1 volume and a RAID 5 volume should be utilized.<br />
C.&nbsp;A single RAID 10 volume should be utilized.<br />
D.&nbsp;A RAID 0 volume and a RAID 5 volume should be utilized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 17</p>
<p>Answer: B</p>
<p><br />
Explanatio n/Reference:<br />
You have to <br />
&nbsp;&quot;maximize the write performance of the transactio n log.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&quot;you should protect the database and transactio n log files, when a drive fails&quot;<br />
To maximimza the perf of the transactio n log and have it protected, for this, you should use the raid 1, because it is a disk mirror and the size is 50GB, the half of the 100GB, but you need two disks for this. Then it will o nly reamins four disks, but you can't have RAID 1 for the data files as the data file is 275GB. So, RAID 5 is the o nly solutio n.</p>

QUESTIo n 18</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. </p>
<p>In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. </p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 servers o n a single site are managed by you. Two SQL Server 2008 instances are co ntained by the site. </p>
<p>o ne is an Enterprise Editio n server, and it is o n a server that has a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) 10 disk system.</p>
<p>The other is a Standard Editio n server, and it is o n a server that has a RAID 5 disk system. </p>
<p>A single applicatio n is hosted by each instance. </p>
<p>A high-availability solutio n should be recommended for the site to satisfy the business requirements listed below. </p>
<p>First, the solutio n can be implemented o n the current systems.<br />
Seco ndly, the database is available with least downtime.<br />
Thirdly, Data loss should be cut to the least.<br />
Fourthly, the existing system should be with least impact. </p>
<p>Which solutio ns should be utilized to finish the task? (Choose more than o ne)</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;To finish the task, Log shipping should be utilized.<br />
B.&nbsp;To finish the task, Failover clustering should be utilized.<br />
C.&nbsp;To finish the task, Replicatio n should be utilized.<br />
D.&nbsp;To finish the task, Database snapshot should be utilized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 18</p>
<p>Answer: AC</p>
<p><br />
Explanatio n/Reference:</p>
<p>Failover clustering is not possible, because the two system are not o n the same array of disk and furthermore, you have to implement it o n the current system.</p>
<p>Database snapshot is not o ne HA solutio n, beacuse it is stored o n the same server.</p>
<p>Replicatio n and Log shipping are both answering to the four requirements.</p>

QUESTIo n 19</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. </p>
<p>In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. </p>
<p>A SQL Server 2008 instance of your company is managed by you. There is a team of database administrators in your company. </p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 Integratio n Services (SSIS) packages are created o n the test server in a shared project by a team of applicatio n developers. A fixed cache file is required by o ne of the packages. </p>
<p>The company will deploy the packages to the productio n server o n completio n of development. The productio n server is available o nly to the database administrators. </p>
<p>Since you are the technical support, you need to co nfirm that the project can be deployed successfully to the productio n server by the applicatio n developers. </p>
<p>Which actio n will you perform to achieve the goal?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;To achieve the goal, the Import and Export Wizard should be utilized to save packages.<br />
B.&nbsp;To achieve the goal, a direct package co nfiguratio n should be created for each package.<br />
C.&nbsp;To achieve the goal, a deployment utility should be created for the SSIS project.<br />
D.&nbsp;To achieve the goal, an indirect package co nfiguratio n should be created for all packages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 19</p>
<p>Answer: C</p>
<p><br />
Explanatio n/Reference:</p>
<p>The first step in deploying packages is to create a deployment utility for an Integratio n Services project. The deployment utility is a folder that co ntains the files you need to deploy the packages in an Integratio n Services project o n a different server. The deployment utility is created o n the computer o n which the Integratio n Services project is stored. </p>
<p>You create a package deployment utility for an Integratio n Services project by first co nfiguring the build process to create a deployment utility, and then building the project. When you build the project, all packages and package co nfiguratio ns in the project are automatically included. To deploy additio nal files such as a Readme file with the project, place the files in the Miscellaneous folder of the Integratio n Services project. When the project is built, these files are also automatically included.</p>
<p>You can co nfigure each project deployment differently. Before you build the project and create the package deployment utility, you can set the properties o n the deployment utility to customize the way the packages in the project will be deployed. For example, you can specify whether package co nfiguratio ns can be updated when the project is deployed. To access the properties of an Integratio n Services project, right-click the project and click Properties.</p>
<p>The following table lists the deployment utility properties. </p>
<p>Property &nbsp;Descriptio n <br />
AllowCo nfiguratio nChange &nbsp;A value that specifies whether co nfiguratio ns can be updated during deployment. <br />
CreateDeploymentUtility &nbsp;A value that specifies whether a package deployment utility is created when the project is built. This property must be True to create a deployment utility. <br />
DeploymentOutputPath &nbsp;The locatio n, relative to the Integratio n Services project, of the deployment utility. </p>
<p>When you build an Integratio n Services project, a manifest file, &lt;project name&gt;. </p>
<p>SSISDeploymentManifest.xml, is created and added, together with copies of the project packages and package dependencies, to the bin\Deployment folder in the project, or to the locatio n specified in the DeploymentOutputPath property. The manifest file lists the packages, the package co nfiguratio ns, and any miscellaneous files in the project.</p>
<p>The co ntent of the deployment folder is refreshed every time that you build the project. This means that any file saved to this folder that is not copied to the folder again by the build process will be deleted. For example, package co nfiguratio n files saved to the deployment folders will be deleted.</p>

QUESTIo n 20</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. </p>
<p>In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. </p>
<p>A SQL Server 2008 instance is managed by you. A 32-bit versio n is utilized by the instance o n a Windows Server 2008 64-bit server. You activate the awe enabled optio n. </p>
<p>A predictable increase in query activity will be experienced by the instance. You are required to figure out the most proper and beneficial time to have the databases migrated to a 64-bit SQL Server 2008 server o n the same hardware. </p>
<p>A data collector type that proper informatio n is provided should be identified. </p>
<p>What kind of collector should you utilize?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;You should utilize SQL Trace collector<br />
B.&nbsp;You should utilize Performance Counters collector<br />
C.&nbsp;You should utilize T-SQL Query collector<br />
D.&nbsp;You should utilize Query Activity collector</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 20</p>
<p>Answer: B</p>
<p><br />
Explanatio n/Reference:</p>
<p>Performance Counters collector is used as it co ntains informatio n about the CPU, Memory and Disk usage of the SQL Server instance. As we need to know if it will be benefit to migrate to 64 bit versio n of SQL Server.</p>
