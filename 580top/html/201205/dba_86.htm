                   <p>QUESTIo n 11</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. A SQL Server 2008 infrastructure is managed by you. </p>
<p>A maintenance strategy should be designed for a missio n-critical database, and a large table named Orders is co ntained by the database. </p>
<p>Index maintenance operatio ns are co ntained in the design plan. When you design the strategy, the facts listed below should be taken into co nsideratio n. </p>
<p>First, the users co ntinuously access to the Orders table in the database.<br />
Seco ndly, a column of the xml data type is co ntained by Orders table. <br />
Thirdly, the new rows are regularly added to the Orders table. <br />
Fourthly, the average fragmentatio n for the clustered index of the Orders table is no more than 2 percent. </p>
<p>A strategy should be designed to have the performance of the queries o n the table optimized. </p>
<p>Which actio n will you perform?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;The clustered index of the Orders table should be dropped.<br />
B.&nbsp;The clustered index of the Orders table offline should be rebuilt o nce a mo nth.<br />
C.&nbsp;The clustered index of the Orders table should be excluded from scheduled reorganizing or rebuilding operatio ns.<br />
D.&nbsp;The clustered index of the Orders table should be reorganized by reducing the fill factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 11</p>
<p>Answer: C</p>
<p>Explanatio n/Reference:</p>
<p>As the users will co ntinously access the database and there is o ne cluster index, the cluster index could not be unavaillable because the leaf pages of the clustered index co ntains the table data.<br />
Furthermore, the cluster index has never o ne fragmentatio n of more than 2%, this means it doesn't need to be reordered.</p>
<p>With this, you can be sure that answer A,B and D are wro ng.</p>
<p><br />
易混淆型，题目要性能，所以重做把集群索引排除。</p>

QUESTIo n 12</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. A SQL Server 2008 instance is managed by you. </p>
<p>The security requirements should be designed for a new database applicatio n. </p>
<p>A code segment is utilized by the applicatio n, and the code segment includes the following compo nents:<br />
A method that the registry is accessed o n the SQL Server, a method that the file system is accessed o n a network file server, and a class definitio n that public static fields are utilized. <br />
SQL CLR integratio n is utilized by the code segment, and the code segment is implemented as a single assembly. </p>
<p>Since you are the technical support, you are required to make sure that the applicatio n should be successfully deployed to the instance. </p>
<p>Which actio n will you perform?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;The SAFE code access security should be utilized for the assembly.<br />
B.&nbsp;All public static fields should be replaced with public fields.<br />
C.&nbsp;All public static fields should be utilized with public static read-o nly fields. And then the assembly shouldbe registered by utilizing the regasm.exe utility before deployment.<br />
D.&nbsp;All public static fields should be replaced with public static read-o nly fields. And then the EXTERNAL_ACCESS code access security should be utilized for the assembly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 12</p>
<p>Answer: D</p>
<p>Explanatio n/Reference:</p>
<p>Creates a managed applicatio n module that co ntains class metadata and managed code as an object in an instance of SQL Server. By referencing this module, commo n language runtime (CLR) functio ns, stored procedures, triggers, user-defined aggregates, and user-defined types can be created in the database. </p>
<p>PERMISSIo n_SET { SAFE | EXTERNAL_ACCESS | UNSAFE } <br />
Specifies a set of code access permissio ns that are granted to the assembly when it is accessed by SQL Server. If not specified, SAFE is applied as the default.</p>
<p>We recommend using SAFE. SAFE is the most restrictive permissio n set. Code executed by an assembly with SAFE permissio ns cannot access external system resources such as files, the network, enviro nment variables, or the registry. </p>
<p>EXTERNAL_ACCESS enables assemblies to access certain external system resources such as files, networks, enviro nmental variables, and the registry.</p>

QUESTIo n 13</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, <br />
optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. </p>
<p>In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. A SQL Server 2008 instance is managed by you. The security requirements should be designed for a new database applicatio n, and the applicatio n will be deployed to the instance. </p>
<p>A table is co nsisted by the new database, and the table is created by utilizing the following code segment: </p>
<p>CREATE TABLE CK_DISCOUNTS <br />
( <br />
ProductID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) <br />
Discount VARBINARY (MAX) FILESTREAM <br />
) </p>
<p>Since you are the technical support, you should utilize the maximum secure method to protect the Bo nusPlan column from the access of unauthorized users. </p>
<p>Which actio n will you perform to finish the task?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;To finish the task, Transparent data encryptio n should be utilized.<br />
B.&nbsp;To finish the task, the NTFS file system security should be utilized and the access of the database files should be limited to the SQL Server 2008 Service account.<br />
C.&nbsp;To finish the task, the Trustworthy optio n for the database should be utilized.<br />
D.&nbsp;To finish the task, the Advanced Encryptio n Standard encryptio n should be utilized o n all columns in the database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 13</p>
<p>Answer: B</p>
<p><br />
Explanatio n/Reference:</p>
<p>The column Bo nusPln is of type FILESTREAM this means that the data of this column is saved outside of the database o n the filesystem. So, you have to protect those files by the NTFS security.</p>

QUESTIo n 14</p>
<p>You are a professio nal level SQL Sever 2008 Database Administrator in an internatio nal corporatio n named Wiikigo. </p>
<p>You are experienced in managing databases in an enterprise-level organizatio n, optimizing and sustaining the database life cycle. In the company, your job is to implement solutio ns o n security, troubleshooting, deployment and optimizatio n. </p>
<p>A SQL Server 2008 infrastructure is managed by you. A database is included by an instance. And a large table named OrderDetails is included by the database. </p>
<p>o nly DML statements o n the last three mo nths data are executed by the applicatio n queries. Administrative audits are managed mo nthly o n data which is lo nger than four mo nths. </p>
<p>The performance problems listed below are found by you in the database. <br />
&nbsp;The performance of the applicatio n queries against the OrderDetail table is poor. <br />
&nbsp;It takes a lo ng time to perform the maintenance tasks against the database, index defragmentatio n is co ntained. </p>
<p>The performance problems should be solved with o n impact o n the server performance. Which actio n will you perform?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;A database snapshot should be created for the OrderDetails table every four mo nths. And then, the queries should be changed to utilize the present snapshot.<br />
B.&nbsp;An additio nal table named OrderDetailsHistory should be created for data older than four mo nths. </p>
<p>And then, the OrderDetails and OrderDetailsHistory tables should be partitio ned in two parts by utilizing the OrderDate column. </p>
<p>At last, a SQL Server Agent job that runs every mo nth should be created and the ALTER TABLE...SWITCH Transact-SQL statement should be utilized to remove data that is lo nger than four mo nths to the OrderDetailsHistory table.<br />
C.&nbsp;An additio nal table named OrderDetailsHistory should be created for data lo nger than four mo nths. <br />
And then, a SQL Server Agent job that runs the following Transact-SQL statement every mo nth should be created. <br />
INSERT INTO OrderDetailsHistory SELECT * FROM OrderDetails WHERE DATEDIFF(m,OrderDate,GETDATE())&gt;4<br />
D.&nbsp;An additio nal table named OrderDetailsHistory should be created for data older than four mo nths. <br />
And then, the following Transact-SQL statement should be utilized. <br />
CREATE TRIGGER trgMoveData o n OrderDetails<br />
AFTER INSERT <br />
AS INSERT INTO OrderDetailsHistory SELECT * FROM<br />
OrderDetailsWHERE DATEDIFF(m,OrderDate,GETDATE())&gt;4</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
QUESTIo n 14</p>
<p>Answer: B</p>
<p><br />
Explanatio n/Reference:<br />
The easiest way to deal with history tables is to use partitio nned tables and the switch command should be use to attach the old data to the history table.</p>
